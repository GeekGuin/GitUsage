# GitUsage
Before starting it would be good to understand the Git Workflow!.

We have 3 important things here:
- Working Directory: This is the folder on your pc with all your project files.
- Staging Area: This is the `.git` folder on your pc that tracks all the changes you
  make to the files on your project.
- Repository: This is where the files get stored once you do `git commit`, you can
  have many branches.
